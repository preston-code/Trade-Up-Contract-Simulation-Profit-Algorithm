# Trade-Up-Contract-Simulation-Profit-Algorithm
This program Scans the current prices of all CSGO skins on the open market and calculates the best Trade up contracts.

The file get_price.py fetches the active price of all CSGO skins from the website csgostash.com

The file avg.py takes all that information and compares it in the 10-1 contract ratio style searching for inconsistencies.
Those inconsistencies are displayed in order of most profitable to least.
